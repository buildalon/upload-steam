This action also assumes some secrets to be set in your repository:

* `STEAM_USERNAME`: The username of your steamworks build account
* `STEAM_PASSWORD`: The password for the account
* `STEAM_SHARED_SECRET`: Optional, a SteamGuard shared secret ([setup steps](#shared-secret))
* `STEAM_CONFIG`: Optional, a steam account config.vdf encoded as base64 string ([setup steps](#config))
* `STEAM_SSFN`: Optional, a steam ssfn file encoded as base64 string. Optional, with `STEAM_CONFIG` setup.
* `STEAM_SSFN_NAME`: Optional, the name of the `STEAM_SSFN` file that was encoded. Required with `STEAM_SSFN`.

### workflow

## Multi-Factor Authentication Setup

Deploying to Steam requires using Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
This action requires at least one of these authentication methods are set:

* `totp`: A temporary one time pass code (totp) from SteamGuard Authenticator app.
* `config`: Steam [config.vdf](#config) encoded as base64 string.
* `shared_secret`: The [shared secret](#shared-secret) from SteamGuard's two-factor authentication.

### Temporary One Time Pass Code

Can be obtained from SteamGuard Authenticator app. Usually is temporary and resets after a set amount of time.

### Config

To setup steamcmd for continuous integration, or just on a machine or VM that will get re-imaged frequently, you'll need to include the config file that contains your login token. Follow these steps so that your initial login token is properly saved:

* Download [steamworks sdk](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted)
* Unzip steamworks in your desired location
* Open in explorer or finder
* Navigate to `sdk/tools/ContentBuilder/builder` (or osx/linux if on non-windows)
* Copy the path to the steamcmd executable (`steamcmd.exe` for windows, `steamcmd.sh` for osx/linux)
* In a new terminal run `<sdk>/steamcmd.exe +login <username>`
  * If prompted, enter your password and the SteamGuard totp
* Type `info`, and you should see your account listed as connected
* Type `quit`
* The folder where you ran `steamcmd` should now contain new content with config directory.
  * `<sdk>/config/config.vdf`
  * If you're unable to locate this file, it can also be located in your steam installation directory
    * windows: `C:/Program Files(x86)/Steam/config/config.vdf`
    * linux: `~/home/<user>/Steam/config/config.vdf`
    * osx: `~/Library/Application\ Support/Steam/config/config.vdf`
* Encode the file to base64 string
  * In a new `bash` terminal run `base64 <sdk>/config/config.vdf > encoded_config.txt`
* Copy the contents of the encoded text file and paste it in `STEAM_CONFIG` secret in github actions.

> [!NOTE]
> If you change your account's security settings or get a new code sent to your email, you'll need to follow these steps again.

### Shared Secret

> [!WARNING]
> Obtaining a shared secret from the SteamGuard Authenticator app is challenging and complicated.
> It is recommended to use the [config](#config) setup.
> This shared secret should not be checked into source control or shared with anyone!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you've already got SteamGuard setup for your account and you remove it, you'll have to wait 3 days before being able to publish a live build.
